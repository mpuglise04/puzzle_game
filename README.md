Description: 
This repository contains the JavaScript code for a 'Puzzle World' game in which the user must pass five levels to win. The first level is "Spot the
Difference," where the player must click on the differences between the two provided images to proceed. For this level the player has one life, so one
mistake and they must start over, directed by a losing screen. 
 
In the second level the player must guess the secret number (randomly generated between 1 and 25). The player has five guesses to do so. However, after
each guess the player is given a hint to either try guessing higher or lower. Once the user guesses the right number, they move on to the next minigame.
  
Level number three is Suduko, where the user must correctly input five numbers into an existing sudoko grid. If the user gets all three right, they move
on to the next level. 

For level four the player must succesffully type in the correct answers for three riddles (one easy, medium, and hard respectively). The player has
three lives (or wrong guesses). The easy riddle reads: The more you take away from me, the bigger I get. What am I? The medium riddle says: 
The more of me there is, the less you see. What am I? Finally, the hard riddle is: I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. What am I? 
Want to find out the answers? Play the game ! No cheating !!!

Finally, level five is the dice game. What's a game without a little luck? To beat this level (and the game) the user must correctly predict
the values of two consecutive dice rolls. 

Once the player beats the fifth level they are greeted by a celebratory victory screen ! Awesome job !
