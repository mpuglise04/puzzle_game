Project Title: 'Puzzle World' Game!

Description:
This repository contains the JavaScript code for a 'Puzzle World' game in which the user must pass five levels to win. The first level is "Spot the
Difference," where the player must click on the differences between the two provided images to proceed. For this level the player has one life, so one
mistake and they must start over, directed by a losing screen. 

In the second level the player must guess the secret number (randomly generated between 1 and 25). The player has five guesses to do so. However, after
each guess the player is given a hint to either try guessing higher or lower. Once the user guesses the right number, they move on to the next minigame. 
  
Level number three is Suduko, where the user must correctly input five numbers into an existing sudoko grid. If the user gets all three right, they move
on to the next level. 
  
  The following code was originally created and compiled on Code.org, now transferred to VSCode/Git.
